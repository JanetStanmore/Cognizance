Pseudo Code for a program to find whether a given number is divisible by 3 or not:

Solution 1#
1. Declare variables Num and r as integer.
2. Enter any number and store it in Num variable.
3. Using while loop, the condition created is (Num >= 3). 
  # If the number satisfies the condition, then it enters the True looping statement. Where it is computed as Num = Num % 3.
  # After completing the loop, it moves towards the False statement, where it is shown r = Num.
4. Here, if-else decision control statement is used, where the condition is; 
  # If (r = 0), The output is " True, the number is divisible by 3. "
  # else, the output is " False, the numbr is ot divisible by 3. "

Solution 2#
 Begin
1. INPUT Num
2. WHILE (Num >= 3)
      Num = Num % 3
    r = Num
3. IF (r = 0)
      THEN PRINT " True, the number is divisible by 3. "
    ELSE PRINT " False, the number is not divisible by 3. "
