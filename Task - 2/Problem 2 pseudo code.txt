Pseudo code for a program to print Nth element of Fibonacci  Series:

Solution 1#
For fibo(n),
Begin
DECLARE int Num, a, b, c, and i
OUTPUT " Enter the number "
INPUT Num
ASSIGN a = 0, b = 1, and c = 0
FOR (i = 1, i <= Num, i++)
  c = a + b
  a = b
  b = c
PRINT " The number is " & c
END

Solution 2#
1. Declaring variables Num, a, b, c and i as integers.
2. Enter a number to store in Num.
3. Here, assigning a = 0, b = 1, and c =0.
4. Applying For conditional statement, where the condition is (i = 1, i <= Num, i++).
   # Compute c = a + b
   # a = b
   # b = c
5. Output will be displayed as " The number is " & c
