Soultion 1#
1. Declare variables Number, n and r as integer.
2. Enter any number and store it in n variable.
3. Here, Number = n.
3. Using while loop, the condition created is (n >= 3). 
  # If the number satisfies the condition, then it enters the True looping statement. Where it is computed as n = n - 3.
  # After completing the loop, it moves towards the False statement, where it is shown r = n.
4. Here, if-else decision control statement is used, where the condition is; 
  # If (r == 0), The output is " True, the number is divisible by 3. "
  # else, the output is " False, the numbr is ot divisible by 3. "

Solution 2#
For n mod 3 == 0,
Begin
DECLARE int Number, n, and r
OUTPUT " Enter a number " 
INPUT n
ASSIGN Number = n
WHILE (n >= 3)
    n = n - 3
  r = n
IF (r = 0)
     THEN PRINT " True, the number is divisible by 3. "
   ELSE PRINT " False, the number is not divisible by 3. "
